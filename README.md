# Amazon Review Analysis
## Collaborators: Hector Castillo Martinez, Justin Stoner, Kelsie Box, Daniel Miller
## Abstract
The rise of online retail over the last twenty years has caused
consumers to increasingly rely on the product reviews of others to
make informed shopping choices. This development combined with
the massive volume of product reviews that are being posted online
has led to several issues in the online shopping ecosystem. A vast
majority of the reviews posted online are not helpful to consumers
for a several reasons. Many lack new and relevant information
related to the product being reviewed; others are highly opinionated
and lack subjectivity; some reviews are fake and often factually
inaccurate which harms the consumer.

We are interested in creating methods to better regulate this
growing online space, so that consumers can save time and money
while shopping online. In this paper, we use the Amazon Customer
Reviews dataset to analyze specific features that a helpful review is
likely to contain. We also propose a method of assigning reviews an
initial helpfulness rating to combat the biased compounding effects
of Amazonâ€™s review listing system. Our model was able to predict
the number of helpful votes a review is likely to receive with 70%
accuracy.
